# DotNet.iOS.SidePanels
This is a direct clone of https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinComponents/tree/main/iOS/SidePanels/source/SidePanels (NuGet https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.SidePanels).
The project ```XamarinComponents``` is abandoned.
The problem is that the component ```SidePanels``` is only compatible with Xamarin.iOS and not the newer .NET versions.

This project releases it with .NET 8.
It can be found under https://www.nuget.org/packages/iOS.SidePanels.
